**Accompanying repository for:** U. Enriquez-Urzelai & L. Gvozdik (under review) Impacts of behaviour and acclimatImpacts of behaviour and acclimation of metabolic rate on sheltered ectothermsâ€™ energetics: a climate change perspective.

This repository contains all the data and code needed to reproduce our paper. 

**Note: This repository contains a modified version of NicheMapR. Due to the constant development of the package, please, use the most recent release from the official repository ([Link](https://github.com/mrke/NicheMapR)) for any application other than replicating the results of this paper.**

To install this version of NicheMapR you have to navigate to `/ThermHydroBehav/nmr_src` and open the NicheMapR.Rproj file. Then, under the build tab, click `Install and Restart`.

Using the R scripts in the `code` folder you can run our biophysical simulations (microclimate and ectotherm models) and reproduce all the figures. In addition, all appendices to the paper and corresponding RMarkdown files are also available.
